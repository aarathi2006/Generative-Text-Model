A lightweight **AI Text Generation** project using **LSTM** and **Flask** that generates **coherent, readable paragraphs** on multiple domains including **Healthcare, Finance, and Education**. The system is domain-aware, memory-efficient, and optimized for low-resource machines.


#  Project Overview

The AI Text Generator takes a **user-provided topic** as input and produces a **coherent paragraph** based on domain-specific datasets. It uses a **custom-trained LSTM model** for text generation and a **Flask frontend** for user interaction.  

# Key Goals:
- Multi-domain text generation
- Readable, meaningful outputs
- Domain detection for better relevance
- Professional single-page interface



# Workflow

The workflow of the project is as follows:

1. **User Input**: The user enters a topic or seed text in the Flask interface.
2. **Domain Detection**: The system detects the domain (Healthcare, Finance, Education) based on keywords.
3. **Text Generation**: 
   - The LSTM model generates word sequences based on the input.
   - Templates ensure readability and correct grammar.
4. **Output Display**: The generated paragraph appears **below the input** on the same page.
5. **Optional Wordwise Generation**: The model can generate additional sentences word by word for variability.
